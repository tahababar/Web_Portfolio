<b>Relationship Test</b><br>
<hr>
		<p>This is a Java program that can read in the set of pairs defining a binary relation over some set of strings and determine some properties of that relation. The input is: a non-negative integer (n) giving the number of strings in the set a sequence of n words (made up of letters, digits, or other symbols, but containing no spaces) naming the distinct strings in the set a non-negative integer (p) giving the number of pairs in the relation a sequence of 2p words, each contained in the set, specifying the pairs: w0, w1, w2, w3, ... means the relation contains the pairs (w0, w1), (w2,w3), ... For example, this input: 3 a b c 4 a a a b b b c c specifies the set {a, b, c} and the relation {(a,a), (a,b), (b,b), (c,c)}. The program checks whether relationship is reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and antisymmetric, and prints out the results. It also prints out whether it is an equivalence relation, a partial order, both, or neither. For example, given the above input, the output is: reflexive not symmetric transitive antisymmetric partial order

<b>Ball in the City Unity 3D Game</b><br>
<hr>
		<p>I created a 3D Unity game. The player controls a spherical ball and is responsible for collecting all the coins in the arena in the least possible time. The intention behind this project was to prepare a learning experience for other students so they can learn the basics and advanced features of game development and can create Unity 3D games on their own. To do this, I created this game and then wrote its documentation.

	<b>Cleaning Olympics and US Census Bureau Dataset</b><br>
	<hr>
		<p> The first part of the project focused on cleaning olympics dataset from Wikipedia. The dataset was based on the number of gold, silver and bronze medals each country have received. I used pandas to find countries' loacations in dataframes, to find which country has won the most gold medals, to find the country which have the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts, and to create a series that allocates points to each country based on their wins. For the second part of the project, I cleaned a data set from the United States Census Bureau that contained the population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. Using pandas, I wrote code to find the state with most counties in it, to find the county with the largest absolute change and to create a query that finds the counties that belong to 2 specific regions, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose population in 2015 was greater than their population in 2014.

<b>Cleaning Energy Supply and GDP Dataset</b><br>
<hr>
		<p> In this project, I cleaned a dataset that included a list of indicators of energy supply and reneweable electricity production from the United Nations. While cleaning, I excluded the footer and the header information and the first two unncessary columns, changed the column labels, converted energy supply to gigajoules, renamed some countries with missing values as NaN and removed numbers or parenthesis from some countries' names. Next, I loaded another file with GDP data of countries from the World Bank website from 1960 to 2015 and cleaned it a little bit. After this, I loaded another file which ranked countries based on their journal contributions in energy engineering and power technology. After cleaning all of these datasets, I merged the three datasets to create a dataframe showing the top 15 countries with greatest journal contributions, along with their corresponding GDP (from 2006-2015), and their corresponding energy supply and reneweable electricity production. Also, I wrote code to perform many other functions. For example, I wrote code to calculate the average GDP over the last 10 years for each country, to create a column that estimates the population using energy supply and energy supply per capita, and to create a column that estimates the number of vitable documents per person.

<b>Cleaning and Plotting Weather Data</b><br><hr>
		<p> In this project, I examined the weather data of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The dataset came from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information Daily Global Historical Climatology Network. I used pandas and numpy to clean the dataset and then used matplotlib to write code that returned a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. I shaded the area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day and overlaid a scatter of the 2015 data for any points for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015. In the end, I removed leap days and made sure to consider issues like legends, labels and chart junk.

<b>Bar Graph Advanced Visualization</b><br>
<hr>
		<p> In this project, I used pandas, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.pyplot to clean a dataset and then create a bar graph that shows the average number of votes in four years for a specific region. I added a horizontal line based on a general number of average votes and then used three colors to compare the votes per year, in respect to that horizontal line. If the number of votes per year lowered the number of votes depicted by the horizontal line, the bar coloring for that year became blue. If the number of votes per year exceeded the number of votes depicted by the horizontal line, the bar coloring for that year became red, and if the number of votes per year were same as the number of votes depicted by the horizontal line, the bar coloring for that year became white. In the end, I also added error bars that reflected the 95% confidence interval for the mean.

a public accessor and mutator for the cipherKeys field, a public method called encodeChar that takes a char representing a single plaintext character and returns the corresponding ciphertext character, a public method called decodeChar that takes a char representing a single
ciphertext character and returns the corresponding plaintext character, a public
method called encodeString that works the same as encodeChar, except that it takes an entire string and returns an entire string, a public method called decodeString that again works like decodeChar, except for strings, and two private methods (charToAlphabetPosition(char c) and alphabetPositionToChar(int pos)) that take character/alphabet and tell us the position of the alphabet/character.

<b>Array-Based and Linked-list based implementation of a "linear structure" ADT</b><br> <hr>
		<p> In this project, I explored the relationship between an array-based and a linked-list
based implementation of a "linear structure" ADT. In the array-based class, I 
wrote the methods that form the interface for the linear structure along with a constructor and a destructor and many private methods to increase or decrease the capacity of the array. The public methods included addToStart(int value) that adds the given value to the beginning of the structure, addToIndex(int value, int index) that adds the given value to the given position in the structure, removeFromStart() that removes the element at the beginning of the structure, and returns it, removeFromIndex(int index) that removes the element at the given position, and returns it, getSize() that returns the size of the structure, get(int index) that returns the element at the given index and 
printAll() that prints each element in the structure in order. In the linked-list class, I coded a constructor and a destructor, along with all the same public methods that I mentioned above. Creating these two separate classes in C++, made me conclude that it is easy to fast index in arrays but adding and removing process is very slow. In the case of linked-lists, however, it is difficult to index, but adding and removing process is fast.

<b>Implementation of a Sorted Stack ADT using a Binary Tree and an Array</b><br><hr>
		<p>  In the project, I implemented the use of a sorted stack that performed some operations. These operations were performed through methods in a C++ class. The methods are push, that puts a new item on the stack, pop, that removes and returns the lowest item from the stack, peek, that returns the lowest item from the stack only, getSize, that returns the number of elements on the stack and isEmpty, that returns true if the stack is empty and false otherwise. The sorted stack was 
implemented using a special kind of binary tree. In the tree, every node was smaller than its children and the tree was represented as an array
without any "gaps" in the array. These rules caused me to create my pop 
and push methods carefully as the binary tree structure was always supposed to be designed in accordance with these rules. I added additional methods such as print which displayed the nodes of the tree in the shape of a tree, and a destructor, a constructor, and other private methods
to increase the capacity of the tree, if necessary.

<b>A Graphics Satellite Rescue Simulation Game</b><br><hr>
		<p>  The project was a 2d game. In the game, a space station has entered the earth's atmosphere. The pilot in our shuttle, should attack the space station, before it crash lands on the earth's surface. The pilot has 5 chances in the form of five fuel cells that can be launched from the shuttle. If a fuel cell comes into contact with the space station, the space station freezes, the shuttle moves towards the space station, takes out the fuel out of the space station and returns back to its original position. The game then ends and the screen closes. Player can select different levels of difficulty as each level determines the speed at which the space station is orbiting.

<b>UniStroke Character Recognition</b><br><hr>
		<p>  In the project, I implemented recognition code for digits using Java's Mouse class. Through the pattern recognition process, I translated the array of points captured by the mouse events. I scaled and normalized those points and compared them with a standard set of patterns, the base set, to find the pattern that best matches the normalized set of points. There were several methods that I created while doing the project. They are findMinX, that returns the smallest x value from the points in the userPoints array, findMinY, that returns the smallest y value from the points in the userPoints array, findMaxX, that returns the largest x value from the points in the userPoints array, findMaxY, that returns the largest y value from the points in the userPoints array, translate, that moved the points in the userPoints array by sliding them as far to the upper-left as possible, scale, that scaled the points in the userPoints array by stretching the user stroke character so it fills the canvas as nearly as possible while maintaining the aspect ratio of the stroke character, computeScore, that computes and returns a score that is a measure of how closely the normalized userPoints array matches a given pattern array in the baseset array, and findMatch, that finds and returns the index of the base set pattern which most closely matches the user stroke.

<b>Advising Transcript for Students</b><br>
<hr>
		<p>  In the project, I developed a system that helps a student to determine his or her progress toward meeting graduation requirements. Through the project, I managed information stored in a file, used ArrayLists and GUI Interface to display data, and used ArrayList methods to sort and categorize data. The full report displayed students's course history, summary information, distribution area fulfillment information, competency status, and courses sorted by GPA.

<b>Bowling Simulation</b><br><hr>
		<p>  In the project, I developed a Java system that displayed a simulation driven by random numbers and manipulation of an array in a game of bowling. For our purposes, the game of bowling consists of throwing a heavy ball down an alley at a set of ten pins. The player bowls ten frames and, except for the tenth frame, has up to two throws per frame. If the player knocks down all ten pins on the first throw, the frame is complete. Otherwise, the player gets one more chance to knock down the remaining pins in that frame. The tenth frame works a little differently, however. The bowler still gets two throws that work the same as in the other frames but if the bowler knocks down all 10 pins, either in the first throw alone or in two throws, then the bowler gets a third throw for that frame. So in frames 1-9, the maximum a bowler can get is 10 pins each. In frame 10, the bowler may get up to 20 pins. Hence, the maximum total score in the bowling game is 110. I wrote methods like displayFrame, updateScore, reset, and playAllGames (that stores the result of each game in an array) etc. to implement the game, in its full form.

<b>Guessing Game</b><br><hr>
		<p> In the project, I created a game that allows computer to generate a random secret value. The player is then asked to guess that value. If the players's value is less than the computer's value, the computer displays "higher", if the players's value is greater than the computer's value, the computer displays "lower", and if the players's value is same as the computer's value, the game ends and the computer displays "You got it!" with a number of the amount of guesses the player had to take to finally guess the secret number.

<b>Two Dice Sum Calculator</b><br><hr>
		<p> In the project, I created a Java class using an array that calculates the sum of two dices thrown, for n number of games. For example, if two dices are thrown a 1000 times, the results should list the sum (from 2 as the lowest sum can be 2 [1+1] to 12 as the highest sum can be 12 [6+6]) along with the number of games, from 1000, in which that sum came.
